# Parcel
What is the use of Parcel?
- It gives a dev build means it is the process of converting source code files into standalone artifact that can be run on a computer.
- It hosts your app on the local server
- It automatically refreshes your changes and displays in your server.It is also called HMR= Hot Module Replacement. 
-Has a File Watching Algorithm(it keeps track of all the things you do in your code and rebuilds whenever you do any changes in your code) which is written in C++ language.
- Faster Builds since it uses the concept of caching(in parcel-cache which has files in binary format)
- It also does Image Optimization
- Minification
- Bundling 
- Compresses the files
- Consistent Hashing (means it independently operates on the number to achieve load balancing and minimize the need for rehashing when the number of nodes in a system changes)
- code splitting (it can split your files)
- differential bundling(provides the support of older browsers where it creates the different bundles for different browsers)
- Diagnostic
- Error Handling
- allows you to host on https also (right now it hosts our page on http)
- Tree Shaking
- Different dev and prod bundles
